# PBoys Project
This project has been created by four students coming from different schools.
This project aims to be like a "RetroGaming" game with the constraint that we could'nt use the computer keyboard and mouse.
For this project, we decided to connect our Blocks game through the camera and our smartphones.

# How to run the code
To lauch the code, you just have to run the file named ```launch.sh```
If you do not have the permission to run this file, do: ```sudo chmod +x launch.sh```

# Concept of the game
It's a multiplayer brick breaker game. You play againt an opponent. You arrive in game and have to choose one of the 6 maps. When your map is chosen you have 2 paddles of different colors(red, and blue). Because we could'nt use our keyboard, we implemented a face recognition system. Thanks to it, you can move the paddle from left to right by moving your head. For each brick you break you receive points. You're goal is to make the most points or be the last one standing with balls. Some of the blocks drops items who can benefits you or disadvantage your opponent.
