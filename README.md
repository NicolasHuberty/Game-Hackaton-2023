# PBoys Project
This project has been created by four students coming from different schools.
This project aims to be like a "RetroGaming" game with the constraint that we could'nt use the computer keyboard and mouse.
For this project, we decided to connect our Blocks game through the camera and our smartphones.

# How to run the code
To lauch the code, you just have to run the file named ```launch.sh```
If you do not have the permission to run this file, do: ```sudo chmod +x launch.sh```
